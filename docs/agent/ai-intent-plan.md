# AI Intent Routing & Surface Inference — Code Map

## Overview

Each incoming chat message flows through a lightweight intent router that classifies the message content and resolves an effective surface for context loading, caching, and tool selection. The system deliberately separates **thread surface** (stable, set at creation, used for UI grouping) from **message context_surface** (per-turn, content-inferred, determines what data the LLM sees). A small internal `TurnExecutionPolicy` layer then turns existing signals (`threadId`, surface routing, `intent_type`, cache eligibility) into deterministic runtime behavior for tools, RAG, context mode, cache lookup, and audit-only grounding checks. Write-prep routing now also gives `prepare_announcement`, `prepare_job_posting`, `prepare_discussion_reply`, and `prepare_discussion_thread` precedence over navigation-style wording when the prompt still clearly looks like creation intent, including chat-style discussion phrasing, announcement publishing prompts, job-creation prompts that say `open`, and structured job-detail pastes. When the draft-session store is unavailable, the handler now also falls back to recent thread history to preserve in-progress job/discussion drafts across follow-up turns instead of dropping back to read-only prose.

## Data Flow

```
Browser URL (/my-org/members)
  └─ routeToSurface(pathname)         → surface = "members"  (client-side)
       │
       ▼
POST /api/ai/{orgId}/chat { message, surface: "members", ... }
  └─ sendMessageSchema.parse()        validates body
       │
       ▼
resolveSurfaceRouting(message, surface)
  ├─ normalizeMessage()               NFC, lowercase, strip zero-width chars
  ├─ isCasualMessage()                → intentType = "casual" for exact greetings/thanks
  ├─ countMatches() × 3 surfaces     keyword scoring
  └─ returns SurfaceRoutingDecision
       ├─ effectiveSurface            may differ from requested surface
       ├─ intent                      e.g. "members_query", "events_query"
       ├─ confidence                  "high" (single winner) / "low" (no matches)
       └─ rerouted                    true if effectiveSurface !== requested
            │
            ▼
init_ai_chat RPC
  p_surface = "members"              → thread.surface (immutable)
  p_context_surface = effectiveSurface → message.context_surface (per-turn)
  p_intent = resolvedIntent           → message.intent

  │    ├─ contextPolicy

  ├─ resolve pass-1 tools from execution policy
  │    → `none` for casual / static_general / out_of_scope
  │    → create-intent write-prep tools win before navigation/read tools
  │    → surface-gated read tools for live_lookup / follow_up otherwise
  │    → if draft-session storage misses, recent thread history can still recover an active draft and re-force the matching write-prep tool
  │
  └─ Stream LLM
       ├─ if successful pass-2 tool summary exists: verifyToolBackedResponse(...)
       └─ logAiRequest({ intent, intentType, contextSurface, ragChunkCount })
```

## Intent Router Algorithm

`resolveSurfaceRouting(message, requestedSurface)` performs four steps:

### Step 1 — Normalize
```
NFC → lowercase → strip zero-width chars (U+200B–U+200D, U+FEFF) → collapse whitespace
```

### Step 2 — Casual Gate
Match against `CASUAL_MESSAGE_PATTERNS`:
- Greetings: `hey`, `hi`, `hello`, `howdy`, `yo`, `sup`, `what's up`
- Acknowledgements: `ok`, `okay`, `got it`, `understood`, `makes sense`, `i see`, `cool`
- Farewells: `bye`, `goodbye`, `see you`, `later`, `cya`, `peace`
- Thanks: `thanks`, `thank you`, `thx`, `ty`, `appreciate it`

These are exact-match checks against the full normalized message. If the entire message is a casual phrase, `intentType` becomes `"casual"`. Retrieval skipping now happens later in `buildTurnExecutionPolicy()`, which can also skip retrieval for structured tool-only turns and keep it enabled for mixed or context-heavy asks. A hybrid like `"hey, what events are coming up?"` fails the exact match and proceeds to keyword scoring normally.

### Step 3 — Keyword Scoring
Count word-boundary regex matches (`(?<!\w)keyword(?!\w)`) per surface:

| Surface | Keywords |
|---|---|
| `members` | member, members, alumni, parent, parents, roster, directory, mentorship |
| `analytics` | analytics, metric, metrics, donation, donations, fundraising, revenue, expense, expenses, budget, budgets, financial, finance |
| `events` | event, events, calendar, schedule, schedules, meeting, meetings, ceremony, game, games, rsvp |

### Step 4 — Decision

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| Zero matches | `effectiveSurface = requestedSurface`, `confidence: "low"` |
| Single highest scorer | `effectiveSurface = winner`, `confidence: "high"`, `rerouted` if winner differs |
| Tie (equal top scores) | `intent: "ambiguous_query"`, falls back to `requestedSurface` |

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Thread surface is immutable; message context_surface is per-turn.** Thread grouping stays stable for UI (thread list filtering, navigation). Each message independently records its effective surface, enabling per-turn analytics.

2. **The execution policy is internal-only.** It does not replace `intent_type`, add schema fields, or create new assistant surfaces. It just centralizes runtime choices that were previously split across handler branches.

3. **Casual turns are now intentionally non-cacheable.** Even when a short first-turn `general` message would pass pure cache eligibility checks, the execution policy skips cache lookup and write for low-value casual turns.

4. **RAG is always non-blocking, and sometimes intentionally skipped.** Retrieval errors are caught and logged; the request continues without chunks. The execution policy skips RAG for casual turns, static `general` explainers, and narrow out-of-scope governance-document asks.

5. **`init_ai_chat` is service-role only.** Users cannot inject arbitrary `context_surface` or `intent` values. The RPC is restricted to `service_role` via explicit `REVOKE`/`GRANT`.

6. **Keyword lists are static and hardcoded.** Adding a new surface requires updating `aiSurfaceEnum` in the schema, `SURFACE_KEYWORDS` in intent-router.ts, `SURFACE_PREFIXES` in route-surface.ts, and `SURFACE_DATA_SOURCES` in context-builder.ts. Adjusting write-intent recognition currently also requires updating the create-intent matchers in the chat handler.

7. **Job URL enrichment is best-effort, not mandatory.** `prepare_job_posting` still attempts safe source intake when a draft is incomplete and a URL may help fill missing fields, but complete user-supplied drafts no longer fail closed just because the source page is oversized or unreadable.

8. **Normalization is shared.** Routing and cache utilities now use the same normalization helper, avoiding silent drift between surface routing and cache-key derivation.
